# Favored Attributes

Favoured Attribute scores represent the characterâ€™s potential to excel when drawing on his experiences and training.  They are the basic
attributes with an added bonus.  To generate the scores possessed by a hero as Favoured Attributes, players add 3 to one Attribute, 
2 to a second Attribute, and 1 to the remaining one.
