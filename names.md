## Names

Character names should be appropriate per the culture.  Below are a few examples:

Bardings - Like most Northmen, Bardings often name their sons and daughters after a renowned ancestor or relative 
or choose a name beginning with the same sound as that of the father.
* Male - Domarr, Karl, Torwald
* Female - Dalla, Inga, Signy

Beornings - The Beornings use bynames and nicknames.  They are gradually embracing the custom of choosing for themselves names honouring their renowned chieftain, either by having a "B" as the first letter or containing the word for Bear (e.g., Balderic, Beranald, Beormud). They further individualise their names by adding a byname, referring to their provenances, occupations, or physical or temperamental qualities (e.g., Arnulf the Old, Berangar the Eloquent). Bynames are often bestowed by an event, especially if connected to a special feat of skill or deed of renown.
* Male - Arnulf, Beranger, Magneric
* Female - Avina, Garsendis, Grimhild
* Bynames - the Bold, the Quiet, the Young

Dwarves - All Dwarves of Durin’s Folk receive a true name at birth that they do not reveal to members of other races. In their dealings with other people, they adopt personal names in the language of other friendly cultures. Dwarves of renown are sometimes given a byname, usually an honorific title celebrating an exceptional deed or distinctive quality (for example, Thorin Oakenshield or Dáin Ironfoot). 
* Male - Borin, Hanar, Regin
* Female - Dis, Hon, Mar
