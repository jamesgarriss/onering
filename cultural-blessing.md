# Cultural Blessings

A cultural blessing is a special ability or quality that is ingrained into the community and thus available to all of its members.

## Bardings

Stout-hearted - When making a test using Valour, Barding characters can roll the Feat die twice, and keep the best result.

## Beornings

Furious - During combat, a Wounded Beorning ignores the effects of being Weary (whether he was injured during the same fight or not). 

## Dwarves

Redoubtable - Dwarf characters calculate their starting Fatigue threshold by adding up the Encumbrance ratings of all the items they are carrying, and then subtracting their favoured Heart score from the total.

## Elves

Folk of the Dusk - When an Elf of Mirkwood is inside a forest or under the earth, or it is night, his Attribute bonuses are based on his favoured rating for all rolls involving the use of a Common skill.

## Hobbits

Hobbit-sense - Each Hobbit character in the group increases the companyâ€™s Fellowship rating by one point. Additionally, when making a Wisdom roll, Hobbits can roll the Feat die twice, and keep the best result.

## Woodmen

Woodcrafty - When the Woodmen fight in the woods, they use their favoured Wits score as their basic Parry rating.
