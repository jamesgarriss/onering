# Callings

Heroes will be leaving behind all they know and love, so they must have a strong motivation to become an adventurer. This motivation is known as a character’s calling.   do not represent a character’s profession or trade , but the ambitions and aspirations that eventually set him on the road. While a calling can be used to summarise a character’s drive as he starts out, they should not be viewed as restrictions; the heroes are likely to evolve in the course of the game.
