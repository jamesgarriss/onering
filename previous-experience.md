# Previous Experience

Players may now raise some of their skill levels, to represent their heroesâ€™ experiences prior to their life as fully-fledged adventurers. 

Players have 10 points to spend on raising their skills.  They can buy new skills and upgrade existing skill, as many levels as they can afford.  The cost of raising each skill is shown below:

## Common Skill Levels

* Level 1 = 1 point
* Level 2 = 2 more points
* Level 3 = 3 more points
* Level 4 = 4 more points
* Level 5 = 5 more points.

If, for example, a player wanted to raise his hero's Hunting skill from level 1 to level 2, it would take 2 points.  If he wanted to raise it to level 3, it would take 3 more points (for a total of 5).

## Weapon SKill Levels

* Level 1 = 2 point
* Level 2 = 4 more points
* Level 3 = 6 more points
