# Ages

Bardings - Bardings don’t usually become adventurers before their 16th year of age, and rarely continue beyond their forties, 
when they retire to serve their family and folk.

Beornings - Beornings don’t usually become adventurers before their 16th year of age, and rarely continue beyond their forties, 
when they retire to serve their family and folk. 

Dwarves - Dwarves generally start their life on the road in their fifties, and do not usually consider retiring before their nineties. 
Around that time, they feel they can no longer stay away from their family, or want to dedicate themselves solely to the perfection 
of their crafts. 

Elves - Elves are invulnerable to age, and may become adventurers at any time after they reach adulthood (at about a century of age).

Hobbits - Hobbits do not easily abandon their comfortable lives, but when they do they usually wait at least for their coming of age at 33. 
But a particularly reckless Hobbit might feel the call to adventure when in his tweens, as Hobbits call their twenties.

Woodmen - Woodmen don’t usually become adventurers before their 16th year of age, and rarely continue beyond their forties, 
when they retire to serve their family and folk.
