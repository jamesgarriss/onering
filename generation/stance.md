# Combat Stance

When in a combat situation, each hero picks a stance, a fighting style.

1. Offensive - an aggressive, close-combat stance that makes it easier to take the initiative (but risks being hit).
2. Balanced - an evenly proportioned, close-combat stance that is equally offense and defense.
3. Defensive - a conservative, close-combat stance that prioritizes self-protection (but decreases the chance of taking the intiative).
4. Ranged - a ranged combat stance that allows the use of bows, spears, throwing daggers, etc.  Requires 2 other heros to have a close-combat stance, thus allowing the ranged hero to stand out of the fight.

All heroes should pick a default stance.  The default stance can be changed before any combat round.
