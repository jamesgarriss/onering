# Combat Stance

When in a combat situation, each hero picks a stance, a fighting style.

1. Forward - an agressive, close-combat stance that makes it easier to hit (and be hit).
2. Open - a well-balanced, close-combat stance that is equal offense and defense.
3. Defensive - a conservative, close-combat stance that prioritizes self-protection.
4. Rearward - a ranged combat stance that allows the use of bows, spears, throwing daggers, etc.  Requires 2 other heros to have a close-combat stance, thus allowing the readward hero to stand out of the fight.

All heroes should pick a default stance.  The default stance can be changed before any combat round.
