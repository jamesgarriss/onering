## Weary 

A hero becomes Weary when his current Endurance score is equal to or lower than his Fatigue rating.  As long as a hero is Weary, all the Success dice he rolls for any test that end up giving a result of 1, 2 or 3 (the outlined numbers) are considered to have rolled a 0 instead.  To remove this state, a hero must have a time of extended rest.
