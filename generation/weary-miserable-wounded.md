# States of Health

At the start of the game, heroes are not weary, miserable, or wounded, so all three of these states are unchecked.

## Weary 

A hero becomes Weary when his current Endurance score is equal to or lower than his Fatigue rating.  As long as a hero is Weary, all the Success dice he rolls for any test that end up giving a result of 1, 2 or 3 (the outlined numbers) are considered to have rolled a 0 instead.  To remove this state, a hero must have a time of extended rest.

## Miserable

A hero becomes Miserable when his current Hope score is equal to or lower than his Shadow rating.  As long as a hero is Miserable, he is in danger of suffering a bout of madness and temporarily lose control of himself.

## Wounded

A hero becomes Wounded when he receives a life-threatening blow, typically from combat.  If a Wounded hero is wounded again, he is unconscious.

If a hero has 0 [Endurance](endurance-hope.md) and is Wounded, then he is considered to be Dying and will pass away soon without help.
