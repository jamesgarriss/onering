# Shadow Weakness

The driving motivation behind an adventurer’s calling can be twisted and perverted if he succumbs to evil temptations or seeks to exert his own will upon others. A character’s Shadow weakness suggests the path he would follow if he failed to resist the Shadow’s influence.

* Scholar - Lure of Secrets
* Slayer - Curse of Vengeance - Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been impugned by an insult. As corruption spreads in the hero’s spirit, his behaviour worsens, leading to more extreme violent reactions.  
* Treasure Hunter - Dragon-sickness - Adventurers who find themselves on the road to seek lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter ashes. As the Shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the world shrinks around them and their closely guarded possessions. 
* Wanderer - Wandering-madness
* Warden - Lure of Power
