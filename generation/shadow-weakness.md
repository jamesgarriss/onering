# Shadow Weakness

The driving motivation behind an adventurer’s calling can be twisted and perverted if he succumbs to evil temptations or seeks to exert his own will upon others. A character’s Shadow weakness suggests the path he would follow if he failed to resist the Shadow’s influence.

* Scholar - Lure of Secrets - Inquisitiveness and curiosity are desirable virtues in an individual, but knowledge can be put to malicious use and learned individuals can look down on others as ignorant fools. Secrets are dangerous, as the very desire of uncovering them may corrupt the heart.
* Slayer - Curse of Vengeance - Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been impugned by an insult. As corruption spreads in the hero’s spirit, his behaviour worsens, leading to more extreme violent reactions.  
* Treasure Hunter - Dragon-sickness - Adventurers who find themselves on the road to seek lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter ashes. As the Shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the world shrinks around them and their closely guarded possessions. 
* Wanderer - Wandering-madness - Wandering without ever really settling down might be the destiny of most adventurers, but it carries the risk of never finding something to live for. The road goes ever on and on, it’s true, but whither then?
* Warden - Lure of Power - When a man is given a position of authority, either by rank, lineage or stature, he may end up mistaking his own wishes for those of the people he should be guiding or keeping safe. Power is the quintessential temptation, and provides the Shadow with an easy way to win the hearts of those who desire it.
