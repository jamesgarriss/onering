## Favored Skill

Heroes already have one favored skill, based upon their culture.  At this point a second favored skill is chosen, one that is based upon their background.  Note that this does not add a new point into the skill, merely gives it favored status.

A favored skill represents a skill in which a hero excels, whether due to natural talent, long experience, or secrets handed down from community or family.
