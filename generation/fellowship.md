# Fellowship

The group of player-heroes is more than a band of roving mercenaries brought together by mere necessity. At its foundation are communal goals and mutual respect. This is recreated in the game by a shared pool of Fellowship points. During the game, players use these points to recover spent Hope.

The number of points available to a company of heroes at the beginning of the game is equal to the number of heroes in the group.
The Loremaster will record the companyâ€™s Fellowship total in a party character sheet. This score is updated every time that a companion uses a point to recover Hope, and it is fully replenished at the beginning of every game session.
