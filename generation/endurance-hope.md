# Endurance and Hope

Endurance and Hope are the fundamental resources that keep a hero going. 



## Hope

A characterâ€™s Hope score defines the reserves of spiritual vigour that heroes draw upon when put in danger. Players can choose to spend a point of Hope to tap a hero's energy reserves and possibly push him beyond his limits. 

* Bardings = 8 + Heart 
* Beornings = 8 + Heart 
* Dwarves = 6 + Heart 
* Elves = 8 + Heart 
* Hobbits = 12 + Heart 
* Woodmen = 10 + Heart

When Hope drops to the same level (or lower) as his Shadow Rating, then the hero is [Miserable](weary-miserable-wounded.md).

If a hero's Hope score is reduced to 0, he is Spent (spiritually drained). A spent hero cannot bear himself to continue a struggle of any sort, and will flee from any source of danger or stress at the first opportunity, unless cornered and forced to fight. 

### Attribute Bonus

Whenever dice are rolled, players may choose to spend a point of Hope to gain a bonus to the result equal to the rating of the most appropriate [Attribute](basic-attributes.md). This is called an Attribute Bonus.

A physical task or test may be modified by Body, a challenge affecting the morale of the character or their relationship with another person would use the Heart score, while a contest of cunning may be affected by their Wits.
