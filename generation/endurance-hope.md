# Endurance and Hope

Endurance and Hope are the fundamental resources that keep a hero going. 

## Endurance

Endurance is the expression of a hero's physical stamina and determination. It is reduced when a hero is subjected to physical harm, stress and exhaustion.

* Bardings = 22 + Heart
* Beornings = 24 + Heart
* Dwarves = 28 + Heart
* Elves = 22 + Heart
* Hobbits = 16 + Heart
* Woodmen = 20 + Heart

During combat, heros lose endurance point to blows.  Endurance can also be lost due to strenuous effort and other physical harm.  When endurance drops to the same level as fatique, then the hero is [weary](weary-miserable-wounded.md).

## Hope

A characterâ€™s Hope score defines the reserves of spiritual vigour that heroes draw upon when put in danger. Players can choose to spend a point of Hope to tap a hero's energy reserves and possibly push him beyond his limits. 

* Bardings = 8 + Heart 
* Beornings = 8 + Heart 
* Dwarves = 6 + Heart 
* Elves = 8 + Heart 
* Hobbits = 12 + Heart 
* Woodmen = 10 + Heart
