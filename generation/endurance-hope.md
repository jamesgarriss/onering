# Endurance and Hope

Endurance and Hope are the fundamental resources that keep a hero going. 

## Endurance

Endurance is the expression of a hero's physical stamina and determination. It is reduced when a hero is subjected to physical harm, stress and exhaustion.

* Bardings = 22 + Heart
* Beornings = 24 + Heart
* Dwarves = 28 + Heart
* Elves = 22 + Heart
* Hobbits = 16 + Heart
* Woodmen = 20 + Heart

During combat, heros lose endurance point to blows.  Endurance can also be lost due to strenuous effort and other physical harm.  When Endurance drops to the same level (or lower) as his Fatique, then the hero is [Weary](weary-miserable-wounded.md).

If Endurance drops to 0, then the hero is exhausted and drops unconscious.

If a hero has 0 Endurance and is [Wounded](weary-miserable-wounded.md), then he is considered to be Dying and will pass away soon without help.

## Hope

A characterâ€™s Hope score defines the reserves of spiritual vigour that heroes draw upon when put in danger. Players can choose to spend a point of Hope to tap a hero's energy reserves and possibly push him beyond his limits. 

* Bardings = 8 + Heart 
* Beornings = 8 + Heart 
* Dwarves = 6 + Heart 
* Elves = 8 + Heart 
* Hobbits = 12 + Heart 
* Woodmen = 10 + Heart

When Hope drops to the same level (or lower) as his Shadow Rating, then the hero is [Miserable](weary-miserable-wounded.md).

If a hero's Hope score is reduced to 0, he is spiritually drained. A spent hero cannot bear himself to continue a struggle of any sort, and will flee from any source of danger or stress at the first opportunity, unless cornered and forced to fight. 

### Attribute Bonus

Whenever dice are rolled, players may choose to spend a point of Hope to gain a bonus to the result equal to the rating of the most appropriate [Attribute](basic-attributes.md). This is called an Attribute Bonus.

A physical task or test may be modified by Body, a challenge affecting the morale of the character or their relationship with another person would use the Heart score, while a contest of cunning may be affected by their Wits.
