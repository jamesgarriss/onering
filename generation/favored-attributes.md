# Favored Attributes

Favored attribute scores represent the heroâ€™s potential to excel when drawing on his experiences and training.  They are the basic
attributes with an added bonus.  To generate the scores possessed by a hero as favored ttributes, players add 3 to one attribute, 
2 to a second attribute, and 1 to the remaining one.  Each hero has both basic attribute values and favored attribute values.

An Attribute's basic rating is used as an Attribute bonus in most tests, and the Attribute's favoured score is used as an Attribute bonus when the hero is using a favoured skill.
