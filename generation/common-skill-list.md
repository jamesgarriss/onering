# Common Skill List

Common skills represent the things a hero has learnt to do.

A favored skill describes a character's peculiar talent in the field described by the ability.  Favored skills (for a given culture) are marked with an (F).

## Definitions

Awe - This skill measures a hero’s capacity to provoke respect in onlookers, and determines the impression a hero makes on someone he meets for the first time. 

Battle - A hero’s proficiency in this skill shows his grasp of the rules of battle, and his ability to keep his head when involved in a violent confrontation

Courtesy - The Free Peoples recognise common norms of decency and ancient conventions of behaviour.  Observing these traditions demonstrates respect and is a way of quickly establishing a friendly footing even with complete strangers.

Craft - The Craft skill doesn’t really cover the whole range of abilities of smiths, wrights and other artisans, but reflects the talent of a character for making or mending things by hand.

Explore - An Explore test may be required during a journey to find the company’s heading, or to get back on track after a detour; to cope with adverse weather conditions or other natural hazards; to create paths through the wilderness suitable for others to follow; or to choose a suitable place to set up camp.

Healing - The knowledge of how to relieve pain and apply remedies to restore health to the suffering.

Hunting -  A Hunting roll may be required when pursuing a creature through wild areas, or to locate tracks and follow them, or to identify a quarry by its spoor. The skill also covers preparing traps and the training and use of hunting dogs or birds.

Insight - Insight is the ability of a hero to see beyond appearances, recognising people’s hidden thoughts and beliefs. Heroes with Insight can recognise when someone is lying, and can draw useful conclusions about people’s motives. 

Inspire - A hero able to Inspire others can instill positive feelings in others, urging them to act on the matter at hand.  This is a feat achieved mainly through example, charisma and personal conviction, rather than through the effective use of words (which falls under Persuade).

Lore - Lore expresses a hero’s love for learning, be it a fascination with descriptions of distant lands, or an interest in family genealogy. 

Persuade - This skill allows a hero to apply his or her reasoning to convince another individual of an idea or course of action. 

Riddle - Owing its name to the ancient Game, the Riddle skill represents a hero’s ability to draw conclusions from seemingly unconnected scraps of information, by deduction, reasoning and intuition.  An adventurer also relies on Riddle whenever he is forced to talk about a subject but wants to conceal part of what he knows, for example to explain something about himself without revealing his true identity. 

Search - Search is used when trying to find something by close examination. This skill may let a hero search a library to locate a piece of relevant information, look for concealed doors or hidden inscriptions, recognise a familiar face in a crowd or even search a suspected thief’s clothing. 

Song - Song is used to recite poems, sing songs or play instruments suitable to the character’s culture. It can also be used to learn new works or create original compositions.

Stealth - A hero resorts to Stealth whenever he needs, or is forced, to act in a furtive or secret way. The skill includes hiding, moving quietly and shadowing others.  Hunters, burglars, and solitary fighters use Stealth to prosper in their trade. 

Travel - In the Third Age, the cities, villages and towns of Middleearth are often separated by many leagues of wild or deserted areas.  When the company needs to cover a distance across uncertain territory, including by boat, every companion is required to perform one or more tests using the Travel skill to avoid becoming weary too soon.
