# Starting Gear

Heroes leave home prepared to spend long periods of time travelling and sleeping in the open. For this reason, every hero is supposed to be carrying the essential equipment for a life of adventuring. This equipment is summarised as a hero's travelling gear and war gear. Any other items, typically things that are special and unique, are noted separately.

All items have an Encumbrance rating, which are used to limit the carrying capacity of a hero to reasonable limits.  Each hero can carry items up to his max Endurance.  Since Encumbrance impacts [fatigue](fatigue.md), it's generally good to keep the Encumbrance lower than the max Endurance.

## Traveling Gear

Traveling gear is all the typical stuff used while adventuring, things like clothes, blankets, flint and steel, rope, and food and water (for one week).  Typically these items are not detailed individually,  During the spring and summer, traveling gear has an Encumbrance of 2; during fall and winter, it has 3.  Traveling gear can include one instrument, if the hero has at least one level in Song.

Each hero starts the game with a set of traveling gear.

## War Gear

Weapons, armor, helms, and shield are individually recorded, and they have unique Encumbrance ratings.

Each hero starts with one of each weapon for which they have a skill point.  For each, record its stats (damage, edge, injury, and encumbrance).

## Other Items

To determine what additional items are possible for a hero, the item should be evaluated against his [standard of living](standard-of-living.md):

* Frugal - Adventurers coming from a Frugal folk do not usually carry anything of unusual worth (unless as part of their war gear), with the possible exception of one or two pieces of expensive clothing or common jewellery, like a rich mantle or a golden necklace or bracelet; probably a token of their status among their peers. Consequently, Frugal adventurers can rarely afford to pay for anything, and prefer to find or make what they need instead.
* Martial - Martial player-heroes have enough resources to look after themselves, and to pay for such things as simple accommodation and meals. Ever mindful of the cost of any luxury, they often lead an austere life, or resort to haggling to lower the price of whatever they are trying to get hold of.
* Characters coming from a Prosperous culture can usually pay for their share of any out of pocket expense encountered along their journey, and might even pay for another companion, if need be. This includes, for example, paying for comfortable accommodation, spending some time drinking in company at an inn, and hiring beasts of burden (such as ponies). 
rich.
* Rich adventurers fare better than their Prosperous fellows, but not excessively so. Their life on the move does not let them take full advantage of their resources, as a good proportion of their wealth will be made up of land and riches.

Any special items that are acquired during an adventure, such as a magical ring, should be noted as part of the gear.

## Fatigue

Every piece (or set) of gear has an Encumbrance rating that represents the hindrance the item causes the hero (weight and discomfort).  The sum of all Encumbrance ratings equals the hero's Fatigue score.
