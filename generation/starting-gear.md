# Starting Gear

Broadly speaking, most of the gear owned by a hero will fall into one of two categories, either his traveling gear or his war gear.  Any other items, typically things that are special and unique, are noted separately.

## Traveling Gear

## War Gear

## Fatigue

Every piece (or set) of gear has an Encumbrance rating that represents the hindrance the item causes the hero (weight and discomfort).  The sum of all Encumbrance ratings equals the hero's Fatigue score.
