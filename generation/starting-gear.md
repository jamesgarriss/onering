# Starting Gear

Broadly speaking, most of the gear owned by a hero will fall into one of two categories, either his traveling gear or his war gear.  Any other items, typically things that are special and unique, are noted separately.

## Traveling Gear

Traveling gear is all the typical stuff used while adventuring, things like clothes, blankets, flint and steel, rope, and food and water (for one week).  Typically these items are not detailed individually,  During the spring and summer, traveling gear has an Encumbrance of 2; during fall and winter, it has 3.  Traveling gear can include one instrument, if the hero has at least one level in Song.

Each hero starts the game with a set of traveling gear.

## War Gear

Weapons, armor, helms, and shield are individually recorded, and they have unique Encumbrance ratings.

Each hero starts with one of each weapon for which they have a skill point.  Stats should be recorded for each weapon.

## Fatigue

Every piece (or set) of gear has an Encumbrance rating that represents the hindrance the item causes the hero (weight and discomfort).  The sum of all Encumbrance ratings equals the hero's Fatigue score.
