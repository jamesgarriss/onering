# Standard of Living

This summarises a culture’s level of prosperity. A cultural Standard of Living can limit a hero’s ability to get hold of certain items.

## Cultures

* Bardings - Prosperous, due to trade with Elves, Dwarves, and lands to the south.
* Beornings - Martial, sustaining themselves by breeding cattle and horses and keeping great hives of bees.
* Dwaves - Rich, due to the restored Kingdom Under the Mountain.
* Elves - Martial, as they are a folk at war.
* Hobbits - Prosperous, as they live in peace in a rich land with protected borders.
* Woodmen - Frugal, constantly fighting the Wood and wild things.

## Definitions

Poor - They struggle every day to find what they need to survive, and have no time or resources to look for anything beyond the bare necessities, let alone equip themselves for adventure. 

Frugal - Frugal folk usually sleep in comfortable common halls (or tents, if nomadic) and eat the produce of their own lands and pastures. They wear simple clothes at most times, although they may possess finer garments for special gatherings like season festivals, marriages or funerals. Jewels and other superior ornaments, if any are in the keeping of members of the society, are treasured as possessions belonging to the community, and are passed down through generations of appointed keepers. Adventurers coming from a Frugal folk do not usually carry anything of unusual worth (unless as part of their war gear), with the possible exception of one or two pieces of expensive clothing or common jewellery, like a rich mantle or a golden necklace or bracelet; probably a token of their status among their peers. Consequently, Frugal adventurers can rarely afford to pay for anything, and prefer to find or make what they need instead.

Martial - Individuals belonging to a Martial culture often live according to their status in the military hierarchy, with simple warriors and soldiers sleeping together in a common area; probably as part of the household of a renowned chieftain or noble. Meals are usually consumed in large halls, with seats and tables arranged to observe rules of precedence or respect. Clothing reflects the military status of an individual as well, or that of his family.  Martial player-heroes have enough resources to look after themselves, and to pay for such things as simple accommodation and meals. Ever mindful of the cost of any luxury, they often lead an austere life, or resort to haggling to lower the price of whatever they are trying to get hold of.

Prosperous - Almost all families belonging to a Prosperous culture can afford to live in separate, private houses. Important individuals wear fine clothing and often have one or more servants in their service at home.  Characters coming from a Prosperous culture can usually pay for their share of any out of pocket expense encountered along their journey, and might even pay for another companion, if need be. This includes, for example, paying for comfortable accommodation, spending some time drinking in company at an inn, and hiring beasts of burden (such as ponies). 

Rich - Members of a Rich culture live amidst all sorts of luxuries, reaping the fruits of flourishing trade or vast treasure. Although those less well-off warn that affluence can easily lead to spiritual or even physical weakness, the availability of material wealth may instead set an individual free to focus on more lofty matters, like the perfection of a trade or art.  Rich adventurers fare better than their Prosperous fellows, but not excessively so. Their life on the move does not let them take full advantage of their resources, as a good proportion of their wealth will be made up of  land and riches.
