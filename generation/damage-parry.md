# Damage and Parry

## Damage

The character’s Damage rating indicates the potential of a hero to do substantial harm to an opponent when able to hit with force and precision, using a close combat or ranged weapon. 

## Parry

 A hero’s Parry score reflects his ability to deflect or in any way avoid an incoming blow. Carrying a shield of any type enhances a character’s Parry rating.
