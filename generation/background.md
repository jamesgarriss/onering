# Backgrounds

## Description

A background begins with a brief description of the hero's personality and some details about his formative years.  The background can be chosen from one of the many pre-generated backgrounds in the game (too many to list here), or it can be created from scratch.  Here are 3 examples:

### A Beorning Background

Since the time your family joined Beorn’s folk you have been a runner, a messenger carrying news for your folk. In your hide shoes, you have countless times trodden the path that goes from the High Pass to the Old Ford, always welcomed by chieftains and families eager to hear your tidings. At times you have brought joy and merriment with news of victory, but also woe and distress with tales of war and defeat.

### A Dwarvish Background

Your grandfather never relented in his hunt for the Orcchief from Mount Gundabad who killed his wife. Leading you along dim underground passages, he told you much about the cruel ways of the servants of the Shadow, and how to fight them. His words scared you when you were young and haunted your dreams, but now that you have started down the road to adventure you begin to see the value of his advice.

### A Hobbitish Background

You grew up peacefully in a farmhouse in the Marish, Eastfarthing, until something Tookish stirred in your blood and overcame your respectability. It first happened on your way home one night, when you spotted some outlandish folk around a bright camp-fire. When you described them to your grandmother, she told you they were Dwarves, on their way to the Blue Mountains. From that night you started to shun well-trodden paths, hoping to meet other wayfarers secretly crossing the Shire. 

## Basic Attributes

The basic attributes are Body, Heart, and Wit, which describe a hero's physical, spiritual, and mental profile.  Each attribute has a basic rating, determined by background, and a favored rating, found by adding a bonus.

* Body (physical aptitude) - A character with a high Body score can be tough and fit, or tall and agile, or even attractive or imposing. Every aspect of a character that relies on vigour or physical well-being is represented in the game by Body.
* Heart (force of spirit) - Measures a hero's capacity for emotion, energy and enthusiasm. A hero with a high Heart score can be fiery, intense, and hard to demoralise. Activities that benefit from a passionate or energetic temper may be influenced by a character’s Heart score.
* Wits (mental aptitude) - A hero with a high Wits rating can be clever, attentive and strong-willed. A sharp-witted person is a quick thinker, and probably alert and vigilant, so any action that calls upon these qualities benefits from a hero’s Wits score.

A physical task or test may be modified by Body, a challenge affecting the morale of the character or their relationship with another person would use the Heart score, while a contest of cunning may be affected by their Wits.

All heroes begin with 14 points to spread among the 3 basic attributes.  They should be prioritized in a manner that correlates with the description.  A healer, for example, would want more points in Heart.  A Dwarven trader would want more points in Body.  An Elvish envoy would want more points in Wits.

## Favored Skill

Heroes already have one favored skill, based upon their culture.  At this point a second favored skill is chosen, one that is based upon their background.  Note that this does not add a new point into the skill, merely gives it favored status.

## Distinctive Features

Distinctive features are type of trait.  Traits describe aspects of an hero’s build, temper and capabilities that under certain circumstances can give them an advantage. There are different uses for Traits, but all are governed by the same principle:  The description of the Trait is essential. In other words, it must be reasonably plausible for someone with the features or qualities described by the Trait to fare better under the circumstances than an individual without them.  Traits are unranked and cannot be improved.

The pre-generated backgrounds have distinctive features to choose from.  If you create your own background, you'll need to select two features that relate to it.
