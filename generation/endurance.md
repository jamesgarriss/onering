# Endurance

Endurance is the expression of a hero's physical stamina and determination. It is reduced when a hero is subjected to physical harm, stress and exhaustion.

* Bardings = 22 + Heart
* Beornings = 24 + Heart
* Dwarves = 28 + Heart
* Elves = 22 + Heart
* Hobbits = 16 + Heart
* Woodmen = 20 + Heart

During combat, heros lose endurance point to blows.  Endurance can also be lost due to strenuous effort and other physical harm.  When Endurance drops to the same level (or lower) as his Fatique, then the hero is [Weary](weary-miserable-wounded.md).

If Endurance drops to 0, then the hero is exhausted and drops unconscious.

If a hero has 0 Endurance and is [Wounded](weary-miserable-wounded.md), then he is considered to be Dying and will pass away soon without help.
