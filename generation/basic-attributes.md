# Basic Attributes

The basic attributes are Body, Heart, and Wit, which describe a hero's physical, spiritual, and mental profile.  Each attribute has a basic rating, determined by background, and a favored rating, found by adding a bonus.

* Body (physical aptitude) - A character with a high Body score can be tough and fit, or tall and agile, or even attractive or imposing. Every aspect of a character that relies on vigour or physical well-being is represented in the game by Body.
* Heart (force of spirit) - Measures a hero's capacity for emotion, energy and enthusiasm. A hero with a high Heart score can be fiery, intense, and hard to demoralise. Activities that benefit from a passionate or energetic temper may be influenced by a character’s Heart score.
* Wits (mental aptitude) - A hero with a high Wits rating can be clever, attentive and strong-willed. A sharp-witted person is a quick thinker, and probably alert and vigilant, so any action that calls upon these qualities benefits from a hero’s Wits score.

A physical task or test may be modified by Body, a challenge affecting the morale of the character or their relationship with another person would use the Heart score, while a contest of cunning may be affected by their Wits.

All heroes begin with 14 points to spread among the 3 basic attributes.  They should be prioritized in a manner that correlates with the description.  A healer, for example, would want more points in Heart.  A Dwarven trader would want more points in Body.  An Elvish envoy would want more points in Wits.
