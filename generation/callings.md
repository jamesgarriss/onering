# Callings

Heroes will be leaving behind all they know and love, so they must have a strong motivation to become an adventurer. This motivation is known as a character’s calling.  Calling does not represent a character’s profession or trade, but the ambitions and aspirations that eventually set him on the road. While a calling can be used to summarise a character’s drive as he starts out, it should not be viewed as a restriction; the heroes are likely to evolve in the course of the game. 

* Scholar - Knowledge makes the wild world a less threatening place to live in.  A love of learning guides your every step, and illuminates the way for you and those who listen to your advice.
* Slayer - You or your family have suffered a terrible loss at another’s hands. You have become an adventurer to take your revenge on whoever wronged you, or maybe just to leave behind a life that you are not able to enjoy any more. Yours is a difficult path to tread, as what you have been through makes it hard to give your trust to anybody.
* Treasure Hunter - Be it a family treasure stolen by raiding Goblins or the golden hoard of a Dragon, you seek what is lost, even when this means you will have to brave unspeakable dangers.
* Wanderer - Every corner of the land holds a promise of untold secrets, and this is why you have decided that any dell, cave and river vale can be your home, albeit briefly.
* Warden - You have sworn to defend all who cannot defend themselves. Often, your choice forces you to forsake civilised areas, to better guard their inhabitants from what lurks right outside their fences. This has made you a stranger to the eyes of the common folk, a threatening figure like those you are protecting them from. 

## Favored Skills

## Additional Trait

Each calling gives a hero an additional, unique trait.

## Shadow Weakness

The driving motivation behind an adventurer’s calling can be twisted and perverted if he succumbs to evil temptations or seeks to exert his own will upon others. A character’s Shadow weakness suggests the path he would follow if he failed to resist the Shadow’s influence.  Record this weakness.

* Scholar - Lure of Secrets - Inquisitiveness and curiosity are desirable virtues in an individual, but knowledge can be put to malicious use and learned individuals can look down on others as ignorant fools. Secrets are dangerous, as the very desire of uncovering them may corrupt the heart.
* Slayer - Curse of Vengeance - Individuals who live by the sword are ever tempted to draw it, either literally or figuratively, when their will is thwarted or when they deem their honour to have been impugned by an insult. As corruption spreads in the hero’s spirit, his behaviour worsens, leading to more extreme violent reactions.  
* Treasure Hunter - Dragon-sickness - Adventurers who find themselves on the road to seek lost riches run the risk of catching the age-old disease capable of turning a pile of enchanted gold into bitter ashes. As the Shadow tightens its grip on their hearts, the world shrinks around them and their closely guarded possessions. 
* Wanderer - Wandering-madness - Wandering without ever really settling down might be the destiny of most adventurers, but it carries the risk of never finding something to live for. The road goes ever on and on, it’s true, but whither then?
* Warden - Lure of Power - When a man is given a position of authority, either by rank, lineage or stature, he may end up mistaking his own wishes for those of the people he should be guiding or keeping safe. Power is the quintessential temptation, and provides the Shadow with an easy way to win the hearts of those who desire it.
