# Callings

Heroes will be leaving behind all they know and love, so they must have a strong motivation to become an adventurer. This motivation is known as a character’s calling.  Calling does not represent a character’s profession or trade, but the ambitions and aspirations that eventually set him on the road. While a calling can be used to summarise a character’s drive as he starts out, it should not be viewed as a restriction; the heroes are likely to evolve in the course of the game. 

* Scholar - Knowledge makes the wild world a less threatening place to live in.  A love of learning guides your every step, and illuminates the way for you and those who listen to your advice.
* Slayer - You or your family have suffered a terrible loss at another’s hands. You have become an adventurer to take your revenge on whoever wronged you, or maybe just to leave behind a life that you are not able to enjoy any more. Yours is a difficult path to tread, as what you have been through makes it hard to give your trust to anybody.
* Treasure Hunter - Be it a family treasure stolen by raiding Goblins or the golden hoard of a Dragon, you seek what is lost, even when this means you will have to brave unspeakable dangers.
* Wanderer - Every corner of the land holds a promise of untold secrets, and this is why you have decided that any dell, cave and river vale can be your home, albeit briefly.
* Warden - You have sworn to defend all who cannot defend themselves. Often, your choice forces you to forsake civilised areas, to better guard their inhabitants from what lurks right outside their fences. This has made you a stranger to the eyes of the common folk, a threatening figure like those you are protecting them from.
