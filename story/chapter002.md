# Chapter 2

Their time in the Elven Halls was both short and boring.  As the Elves neither knew them nor trusted them, Balwulf, Bjorn, and Treadnor--especially Treadnor--were not permitted to leave the cellars.

With an apologetic shrug, Baldor said, "Perhaps it's best if you remain here and guard the supplies, 'till we can leave again.  I'll send down some food and wine."

For two days they sat around, talking quietly and occasionally sleeping, all under the watchful eye of the Butler.  It wasn't all bad.  True to his word, Baldor sent down several loaves of the most delicious bread, two small jars of jam, and a fine bottle of Elvish wine, a light and fruity variety that none of them had ever tasted before.

"Makes that ale they drink in Lake-town taste rather like pig-swill," decided Treadnor, as he helped himself to another drink.

Finally, Baldor and Belgo returned in the company of the elves from the rafts.  "I trust your stay was acceptable," smiled the merchant.  

The Elves escorted them all, along with the ponies and their wares, out of the cellars along a secret path.  It was long, dark, twisted, and utterly confusing to Balwulf and Bjorn, neither of whom had spent much time underground.  Eventually they came out near the Elf-path, the roadway that the Elves kept open, as much as they could.  The trees all around were beech, and sunlight filtered down through their leaves to light their way with a beautiful, golden light.

"Here is your way," said one of the Elves, pointing in a westerly direction.  "If you pass through the forest, you will reach the Forest Gate and look upon the Anduin Vales.  Turning south, you will find yourself home again."  This last comment was direct at Balwulf.  "We will take you past the Enchanted Stream, but no further."

At Baldor's nod of agreement, the Elves began to march, setting a hard pace.  By nightfall, they reach the stream.

"We will camp here for the night and depart in the morning," said the Elves.  "Rest well, friends, and we will guard your sleep."  

Huddled around the small campfire, Baldor, Belgo, and the others slept fittfully and awoke often.  But whenever they looked around, they saw one of the Elves, alert and watchful.

In the mornin, while the light was still more dark than dim and steam rose from the waters of the stream, the Elves gave a sharp whistle.  Another Elf appeared from across the stream.  They tossed a rope to him, and he tossed another back; in short order a simple rope bridge spanned the stream.  The ponies were unloaded, and the Elves nimbly walked back and forth with their supplies.  Using lead ropes and quiet word, the ponies were encouraged to swim across, and they seemed to suffer no ill effects from the water.

"Your turn," smiled the Elves, looking at the travelers.
