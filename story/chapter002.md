# Chapter 2

18 Rethe, TA 2947

Their time in the Elven Halls was both short and boring.  As the Elves neither knew them nor trusted them, Balwulf, Bjorn, and Treadnor--especially Treadnor--were not permitted to leave the cellars.

With an apologetic shrug, Baldor said, "Perhaps it's best if you remain here and guard the supplies, 'till we can leave again.  I'll send down some food and wine."

For two days they sat around, talking quietly and occasionally sleeping, all under the watchful eye of the Butler.  It wasn't all bad.  True to his word, Baldor sent down several loaves of the most delicious bread, two small jars of jam, and a fine bottle of Elvish wine, a light and fruity variety that none of them had ever tasted before.

"Makes that ale they drink in Lake-town taste rather like pig-swill," decided Treadnor, as he helped himself to another drink.

Finally, Baldor and Belgo returned in the company of the elves from the rafts.  "I trust your stay was acceptable," smiled the merchant.

The Elves escorted them all, along with the ponies and their wares, out of the cellars along a secret path.  It was long, dark, twisted, and utterly confusing to Balwulf and Bjorn, neither of whom had spent much time underground.  Eventually they came out near the Elf-path, the roadway that the Elves kept open, as much as they could.  The trees all around were beech, and sunlight filtered down through their leaves to light their way with a beautiful, golden light.

"Here is your way," said one of the Elves, pointing in a westerly direction.  "If you pass through the forest, you will reach the Forest Gate and look upon the Anduin Vales.  Turning south, you will find yourself home again."  This last comment was direct at Balwulf.  "We will take you past the Enchanted Stream, but no further."

At Baldor's nod of agreement, the Elves began to march, setting a hard pace.  By nightfall, they reach the stream.

"We will camp here for the night and depart in the morning," said the Elves.  "Rest well, friends, and we will guard your sleep."  

Huddled around the small campfire, Baldor, Belgo, and the others slept fittfully and awoke often.  But whenever they looked around, they saw one of the Elves, alert and watchful.

In the mornin, while the light was still more dark than dim and steam rose from the waters of the stream, the Elves gave a sharp whistle.  Another Elf appeared from across the stream.  They tossed a rope to him, and he tossed another back; in short order a simple rope bridge spanned the stream.  The ponies were unloaded, and the Elves nimbly walked back and forth with their supplies.  Using lead ropes and quiet word, the ponies were encouraged to swim across, and they seemed to suffer no ill effects from the water.

"Your turn," smiled the Elves, looking at the travelers.

Balwulf looked dubiously at the shaky rope bridge and then at his own large bulk. "Are you certain I'm not going to...well...sink your whole bridge?"

The Elves just laughed.  "Fat little spider, this web will hold you!  We don't want Father Dwarf's beard wagging in the water!"  And they laughed again.

Balwulf plucked up his courage and gave the ropes a try.  To his surprise, he found them to be firm and stable.  By the time he was half way across, he  was walking easily without even using the guide rope.  He was soon on the other side, looking back.  The Dwarf, seeing that Bjarn hesitated, scrambled up onto the rope, and steadily if carefully made his way across.  Seeing the consistent reliability of the rope bridge, Bjarn took his turn across.  Like the others, he found it easier than expected and was soon on the other side.  Baldor crossed slower than the others, and the Elves carried his son, pretending twice to nearly drop him, much to his delight.  In the end, they were all safely across, and the bridge was dismantled as quickly as it was set up.  The Elves bid them farewell with a final reminder:  Don't leave the path!

"I'm tired of hearing that," grunted Baldor.  "But it's good advice.  Well, I reckon it will take us twenty-four days, give or take, to reach the Forest Gate.  As long as we stay together, and on the path, what could happen?"  His smile looked a bit forced.

Balwulf patted the small ferret which had crawled up to his shoulders to snuggle around his beard, and smiled optimistically at the merchant. “I’m sure we’ll be fine.”

Baldor raised his eyes at that, but didn't respond except to begin loading the packs back upon the ponies.

For three days the company had marched their way through Mirkwood.  They woke early, walked fast, and camped right next to the path.  The beeches had gradually faded, the light had dimmed, and the oppressiveness had grown.  Still, nothing had hindered their progress, and they had seen neither man nor beast.

Late one afternoon, Bjarn, who was on point, raised a fist over his head, the signal they had agreed upon to stop and be quiet.  As Belgo went back to lend a hand with the ponies, Baldor and Treadnor quietly joined Bjarn, who simply pointed down the path.  Balwulf immediately saw the problem:  Two strands of a thin, white rope crossed the path 15 yards in front of them.  Treadnor merely squinted. 

Bjarn took a closer look at the chords, trying to follow them to see where they led.  Unfortunatley, the light was too dim, and from where he stood, Bjarn couldn't tell where the chords went.  Balwulf approached the ropes to determine why they were there and if putting pressure on them would harm anything.  The ropes crossed the path in an "X" pattern.  In the center, they were about three feet off the ground, so while Belgo could probably get under them easily, the others would have to bend over.  The ponies would need help.  As for why, neither Balwulf nor Bjarn could not discern any reason for rope to be here.

"Don't touch that!," whispered Treadnor urgently.  "That's the start of a spider web!  It'll stick to your skin something fierce!"

“Can we cut them?” Balwulf asked Treadnor in a low tone.

"Easy, but that will alert the spiders."

Balwulf glanced at Bjarn. “Well? Any ideas?”

"I do," interjected Treadnor.  "Be somewhere else before we make camp tonight."

"Let's get going then." Balwulf motioned for the merchant and his son to go through first. "Be careful; don't touch that web."

Treadnor went back to grab the lead of the first pony, while Baldor and Belgo came forward.  The father bent over double and shuffled under, while the son merely had to tilt his head.  They kept an eye forward.

Bjarn squinted at the web one last time before bowing to go beneath the threads.

"Alright, Treadnor," Balwulf said. "How are we going to get these ponies through?"

The Dwarf led the ponies forward.  "Branches?" he relied. "Use them to hold the rope up high."

Bjarn piped in, "If we move the webbing, won't the spiders feel it?"

"Probably, but if we stay here, they will definitely notice us."

"Why don't we have someone hold them while we cut them and tie them off to some trees?  We just need to keep them steady while we do it. "

"Good idea," agreed the Dwarf, "But you can’t touch the webs.  Too sticky."

Pointing to the web, Bjarn pitched an idea, "I can make an oil that will allow us to handle the webbing without getting stuck to it. I'll need some help finding the right herbs though."

"Excellent." Balwulf agreed. "What do you need to find?"

"Asphodel and aeglos," he replied.  "I have some of the former in my kit, but we'd need to find Aeglos.  It's a tall, thorny plant with a white, sweet-smelling flower.  I need its roots."

"Do you have anything that looks similar to it or a drawing of any sort?" he asked. "My Hobbit can find such a thing, but only if he knows what he is looking for."

"No, I don't" replied the Woodsman.  "We'll just have to do it ourselves."  He walked off to the side of the path, a short distance from the webs and began searching for the plant, careful to keep an eye out for any more webs in the area.

The Beorning nodded in agreement and started in the opposite direction of Balwulf to search.

As they left the path, the merchant hissed in protest.  "The Elves!  They said never to leave the path!"

Bjarn glanced towards the merchant. "Well, the Elves aren't here to help, are they?"

Baldor's eyes bulged slightly, but he didn't reply.   Not much he could do but continue to look for spiders.

As he searched, Balwulf felt rather like a bee in the wrong hive.  The plants here all looked alike, and none looked like Bjarn's description.  Bjarn, on the other hand, felt perfectly at home.  Having spent endless hours in southern part of the forest searching for herbs, he was able to relax while quickly searching for aeglos.

"Dad!" called Belgo softly.

His father gasped and said, "The webs!  They are moving!"

Hearing the child, Bjarn reached for his bow and charged back to the group, as did Balwulf.

From the north side of the path a chittering sound could be heard, like kids clacking small sticks together.  Clearly more than one spider was coming though the gloom.  Soon the spiders were close enough to be seen.  Four were coming on the web, and four more along the ground.  The spiders were huge, the size of a big dog!  With the stroke of his mattock, Treadnor cut the webs over the path, dropping the first group of spiders onto the second and buying them a few more seconds.

"Get the ponies!" he yelled to Baldor.

The merchant and his son grabbed a couple ponies each and began moving further down the path.  The spiders, having recovered, were nearly to the remaining three.

Balwulf pulled his axe from his back and yelled at the merchant and his son to run. He stood his ground against the spiders and prepared to swing his axe as soon as they were in range.  Treadnor stepped up beside Balwulf and grinned fiercely at him.  Positioning himself behind the other two, Bjarn drew his bow and nocked an arrow locked.  He fired swiftly at the nearest of their arachnid nemese, but his first shot missed the target and went sailing off into the forest.  As the spiders drew close, he tried to nock a second arrow to his bow but with gaze still on the spiders he missed the string and dropped both the bow and the arrow!

Two of the spiders came at Balwulf, but he was the quicker to strike, though his axe gave only a glancing blow off the side of one spider.  Treadnor planted his feet solidly and two more of the spiders came at him.  He calmly side-stepped the first spider's attack, inserting it between himself and the second. Seeing a spider charging him, Bjarn left his bow on the ground and grabbed his long-hafted axe instead.

A third spider joined the attack against Balwulf, who suddenly found himself on the defensive.  He evaded one attack, but the other spider jumped suddenly and stung him in the chest, right over his heart.  Fortunately his armor blocked the stinger.  Treadnor also faced three spiders.  The first tried to sting his leg, but the stocky Dwarf stepped one side and swung this mattock with all this might.  The spider literally exploded and body parts scattered all over the path.  The second spider timed his attack perfectl and stung Treadnor in the other leg.  The third missed.  Bjarn attacked quickly, but mis-judged the height of his eight-footed foe.  His swing went right over and left him unbalanced.  The spider jumped and stung Bjarn right in the middle of his back.  It was a burning pain, like a spider bite from a normal spider, only a hundred times more.

Balwulf took charge of his fight once again, quickly jumping in and smacking one of his spiders.  Treadnor's remaining spiders tried again to sting him, but he neatly avoided both and with one counter-stroke killed one and wounded the other.  Bjarn traded missing swipes with one of his spiders, while side-stepping the other.

Balwulf continued to dance, keeping the spiders lined up so they couldn't all attack him at once.  When one tried to jump and sting him, Balwulf swung and chopped off all four legs on the left side of his body.  The spider dropped lifeless to the path.  Treadnor's spider squirted a strand of webbing at him, but the attack was awkward at best, and the Dwarf easily evaded it.  Bjarn again attacked quickly and planted the haft of his long axe right into the head of the nearest spider, whose brains came exploding out.

With half their numbers dead, the spiders quickly retreated, hissing and clacking at the party as they left.

Bjarn, groaning from the pain in his back, assessed the damage to the party.  Balwulf gave an "all clear" thumbs up, and Treadnor waved him away, dismissing the pain as insignificant.

"What about you, Bjarn?" Balwulf asked, "How badly did it hit you?"

"I got one pretty good in my back. My leggs feel tingly. Would you mind taking a look at it and telling me how bad it is?"
