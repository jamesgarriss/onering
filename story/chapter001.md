# Chapter 1

15 Rethe, TA 2947

When Bard the Bowman shot and killed the Smaug the Terrible, the dragon fell straight upon Lake-town.  The impact, along with the fire, ahd ruined the town, so the people of Lake-town had rebuilt their town, leaving the ruins of the old town where it lay.  On days when the wind was calm and the sun was bright, the remains of the dragon could sometimes still be seen, resting on the bottom of Long Lake.  Every so often one of the gems from the carcass washed ashore, and the lucky person who found it would be rich for a while.

Somewhat amusingly, this had led to a new, albeit niche, industry for Lake-town:  treasure-hunting.  Tourists were offered a chance to be led to the old town by an expert guide who would row them out onto the lake at just the right time of day where they could catch a glimpse of the dragon.  The guide would give a dramatic re-telling of the story of the battle, pointing out where key buildings, such as the Master's house, had been located.  Afterward, they would head back to shore and scour the coast of the lake together, hoping to be one of the lucky few who found a dragon-gem. 

One such expert guide was Grimstan, a crusty, old, former-fisherman who had spent most of his life on the waters of the lake.  One day he found himself guiding a party of three, a Beorning, a Woodsman, and a Dwarf.  They were an odd group, to be sure.  The Beorning and the Woodsman got along well enough, but neither seemed to pay that much attention to the Dwarf, and he seemed quite content with that.

"Come over this way," encouraged Grimstan.  "See this area of the shore here?  This is where a lady from Dale found an emerald just last week!  It was the size of my thumb, I say!  A beautiful piece of stone that undoubtedly set her up for the coming year."

While the Woodman, Bjarn, found all of this fascinating, he took everything that Grimstan said with a grain of salt. Not only was he a natural skeptic, but being outside of his comfortable woodland surroundings had caused him to be a little on edge. On the other hand, he was eager to meet new people and enjoyed the prospect that he may learn things that would help him in his own journey.

In contrast, the Beorning, Balwulf, followed the guide excitedly, hanging on his every word. He was never more than a step behind the other human, and he thrilled on the little pieces of trivia from him.

The Dwarf, Treadnor, grunted under his breath, not particularly believing the guide.  He had only come because the others has asked him to.  Still, it didn't hurt to look.  When the others were busy looking at the shoreline that Grimstan was pointing to, the Dwarf moved a bit further south and began to look.  He used his mattock to poke and prod at the various and rocks that lined the shore, looking to see if there were any gems among them.

The company continued to work its way south along the shore, searching carefully all the way.  Slowly the landscape became more rough.  Cattails grew along the waterfront, stunted trees dotted the landscape, and weeds and briars began to appear.  It became harder to search, and their visibility was restricted.  Despite their meticulous scouring, they didn't find any dragon treasure.

Suddenly they heard a shout, "Help!  Help me!"  The sounds of someone running through the bush came from further south, an area where they had not yet explored.

As the boy's words tumbled out of him, they were able to make out his story.  His father was a merchant from Dale, caravanning a load of goods for trade on the other side of Mirkwood.  He hired three guards for protection, but the guards attacked his father instead.  If they hurried back with him, they could help his father.

Balwulf hesitates for only a moment before rushing off towards the sound, not waiting to see if his party members are following.  The Dwarf took a firm grip on his mattock and followed after, leaving the healer behind.  Not wanting to be left out, Bjarn runs after the others, hoping to assist however he can.

After pushing through bush for about 20 yards, a young boy suddenly burst out of the rushes ahead of them.  Upon seeing Balwulf,  Treadnor, and Bjarn he ran right towards them, waving his arms.  Tears spill down his checks as he cried out, "Help me, please!  My father, the guards, they are going to kill him!  Going to Mirkwood, but not!  He told me to run!  Help!"

Bjarn placed a firm hand on the boys shoulder. "What happened to him, boy?"

As the boy's words tumbled out of him, they were able to make out his story.  His father was a merchant from Dale, caravanning a load of goods for trade on the other side of Mirkwood.  He hired three guards for protection, but the guards attacked his father instead.  If they hurried back with him, they could help his father.

The boy grabbed Bjarn's hand in his and tried to pull him back in the direction from which he had come.
