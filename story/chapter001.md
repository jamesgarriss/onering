# Chapter 1

15 Rethe, TA 2947

When Bard the Bowman shot and killed the Smaug the Terrible, the dragon fell straight upon Lake-town.  The impact, along with the fire, ahd ruined the town, so the people of Lake-town had rebuilt their town, leaving the ruins of the old town where it lay.  On days when the wind was calm and the sun was bright, the remains of the dragon could sometimes still be seen, resting on the bottom of Long Lake.  Every so often one of the gems from the carcass washed ashore, and the lucky person who found it would be rich for a while.

Somewhat amusingly, this had led to a new, albeit niche, industry for Lake-town:  treasure-hunting.  Tourists were offered a chance to be led to the old town by an expert guide who would row them out onto the lake at just the right time of day where they could catch a glimpse of the dragon.  The guide would give a dramatic re-telling of the story of the battle, pointing out where key buildings, such as the Master's house, had been located.  Afterward, they would head back to shore and scour the coast of the lake together, hoping to be one of the lucky few who found a dragon-gem. 

One such expert guide was Grimstan, a crusty, old, former-fisherman who had spent most of his life on the waters of the lake.  One day he found himself guiding a party of three, a Beorning, a Woodsman, and a Dwarf.  They were an odd group, to be sure.  The Beorning and the Woodsman got along well enough, but neither seemed to pay that much attention to the Dwarf, and he seemed quite content with that.

"Come over this way," encouraged Grimstan.  "See this area of the shore here?  This is where a lady from Dale found an emerald just last week!  It was the size of my thumb, I say!  A beautiful piece of stone that undoubtedly set her up for the coming year."

While the Woodman, Bjarn, found all of this fascinating, he took everything that Grimstan said with a grain of salt. Not only was he a natural skeptic, but being outside of his comfortable woodland surroundings had caused him to be a little on edge. On the other hand, he was eager to meet new people and enjoyed the prospect that he may learn things that would help him in his own journey.

In contrast, the Beorning, Balwulf, followed the guide excitedly, hanging on his every word. He was never more than a step behind the other human, and he thrilled on the little pieces of trivia from him.

The Dwarf, Treadnor, grunted under his breath, not particularly believing the guide.  He had only come because the others has asked him to.  Still, it didn't hurt to look.  When the others were busy looking at the shoreline that Grimstan was pointing to, the Dwarf moved a bit further south and began to look.  He used his mattock to poke and prod at the various and rocks that lined the shore, looking to see if there were any gems among them.

The company continued to work its way south along the shore, searching carefully all the way.  Slowly the landscape became more rough.  Cattails grew along the waterfront, stunted trees dotted the landscape, and weeds and briars began to appear.  It became harder to search, and their visibility was restricted.  Despite their meticulous scouring, they didn't find any dragon treasure.

Suddenly they heard a shout, "Help!  Help me!"  The sounds of someone running through the bush came from further south, an area where they had not yet explored.

As the boy's words tumbled out of him, they were able to make out his story.  His father was a merchant from Dale, caravanning a load of goods for trade on the other side of Mirkwood.  He hired three guards for protection, but the guards attacked his father instead.  If they hurried back with him, they could help his father.

Balwulf hesitates for only a moment before rushing off towards the sound, not waiting to see if his party members are following.  The Dwarf took a firm grip on his mattock and followed after, leaving the healer behind.  Not wanting to be left out, Bjarn runs after the others, hoping to assist however he can.

After pushing through bush for about 20 yards, a young boy suddenly burst out of the rushes ahead of them.  Upon seeing Balwulf,  Treadnor, and Bjarn he ran right towards them, waving his arms.  Tears spill down his checks as he cried out, "Help me, please!  My father, the guards, they are going to kill him!  Going to Mirkwood, but not!  He told me to run!  Help!"

Bjarn placed a firm hand on the boy's shoulder. "What happened to him, boy?"

As the boy's words tumbled out of him, they were able to make out his story.  His father was a merchant from Dale, caravanning a load of goods for trade on the other side of Mirkwood.  He hired three guards for protection, but the guards attacked his father instead.  If they hurried back with him, they could help his father.

The boy grabbed Bjarn's hand in his and tried to pull him back in the direction from which he had come.

Balwulf pulled his axe from his back and nodded in the boy’s direction. “Of course we’ll help. Lead on.”

The Dwarf grunted what Bjarn took to be an approving grunt.

Pulling on Bjarn's hand, the boy dragged them back the way he had come.  Soon they came to an old path, and when they followed it down towards the lake, they came upon a small clearing.  In it a middle-aged man had his back to a tree and awkwardly, if determinedly, held a sturdy branch in his hands.  Fanned out in front on him were three other men, all with drawn swords.  One had a nasty bruise on his forehead, evidence that the branch had recently been used.

Bjarn thought to himself, "I think I found our problem." He looked worriedly at the men.

Balwulf stepped out toward the men and called out, "I don’t think you all should be here. Perhaps you should walk away."  He gripped his axe tightly by his side, but didn’t raise it. Yet.

The biggest of the three men waved his free arm at Balwuf and yelled back, "Get out of here!  This is none of your business!"

Balwulf cautiously took another step forward and said, "I think it is; I think it’s all of our business right now." He glanced back to make sure the other two were with him.

Bjarn gave a slight nod to Balwulf, making sure his bow was handy, and Treadnor raised his mattock just enough to ensure it was in plain sight.

One of the other men turned towards Balwulf and replied, "This man," he waved dismissively at the one with the branch, "cheated us back in Dale.  All we are doing is collecting on his debt."  He pointed south through the bushes and said, "His ponies have some supplies.  We'll get our fair share and leave the rest.  So take the boy and the man and back off.  You can have the rest of the ponies when we're gone."

Balwulf hesitated and then glanced back at his companions again. A moment ago he had been so sure of himself, but now he wasn’t as sure of what they should do.

Bjarn knew if they were to get in the way of these men they would be putting themselves and the boy in danger. He spoke up, "Take only what you are owed, but leave the father and his boy alone."

"What?!" protested the man with the branch.  "I stole nothing!  I cheated no one!  I am Baldor, an honest merchant from Dale, and I hired these men to guard my caravan.  I am on my way to the Woodland Hall and then through Mirkwood, and I hired them in Lake-town.  You can’t give away my wares!"  His voice had turned pleading as he realized these strangers were about to give away his livelihood.

Balwulf raised his axe to point at the man who had claimed they were cheated and said, "What proof can you offer that this man has cheated you?"

"You have my word," he replied quickly.  "Our word.  And it’s three of our words against only one of his." His two friends nodded their agreement.

“Your word,” sputtered Baldor.  “Your word?!” he screamed, his face turning red.  “You gave your word to guard my caravan!  Your word is as good as goblin scat!”

“Your word,” Balwulf spoke quickly over Baldor’s sputtering, “is not proof that you have been cheated. As the three of you are working together, all three of your words are worth no more than his. Have you any proof of what he owes?”

As the men turned to look at the Beorning, Baldor hefted his cudgel, yelled "I’ll give you some word!" and took a mighty swing at the one he’d already hit once. He landed a mighty blow right in the middle of his foe’s back, knocking him forward onto his hands and knees, where he gasped for breath.

Treadnor barked a short laugh of appreciation.
