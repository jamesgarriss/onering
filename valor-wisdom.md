# Valor and Wisdom

Valour and Wisdom measure a hero’s resistance to Fear and the Shadow, and track his stature in terms of power and renown. 

* A hero's Valour rank describes his stature as a doer of great deeds and is a measure of his courage in the face of dangerous situations or opponents.  
* A character’s Wisdom rank defines his self-understanding and capability for good judgement and is a measure of his resistance to the corrupting power of the Shadow.

Both scores range from 1 to 6, and rise over the course of the game.  A starting player gives a score of 2 to one characteristic and 1 to the other. If a player chose to put 2 puts into Valor, then the hero will receive a Reward.  If Wisdom, then the hero will receive a Virtue. When heros gain a rank, they will put an additional point into either Valor or Wisdom and will recieve either an additional Virtue or Reward.

## Virtues

Virtues are unique abilities and special talents.  They represent a special quality or talents practised until they become second nature.  All are beneficial, but often apply only under strict conditions. As these requisites are as varied as the effects of the Virtues themselves, players are advised to read each Virtue description carefully, to understand when best to use it. 

### Masteries

These talents can be acquired by adventurers from any culture. Each Mastery can be acquired more than once by the same character.

Confidence - Overcoming difficulties has hardened your spirit, and at the same time renewed your faith in a brighter future.  Raise your maximum Hope rating by 2 points. When you choose this mastery, set your Hope score again to its maximum rating.

Dour-handed - When you throw a weapon or bend your bow, your hand is steady and your aim is sure.  Raise your ranged Damage rating by 1. 

Expertise - You have practised a skill until it has become as natural as breathing.  You can choose a new favoured skill (either a Common skill or a Weapon skill).

### Cultural Virtues 

Cultural Virtues are the secrets of the dwellers of Middle-earth, from the proverbial stubbornness of Dwarves to the subtle magic of Elves
