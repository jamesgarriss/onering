# Valor and Wisdom

Valour and Wisdom measure a hero’s resistance to Fear and the Shadow, and track his stature in terms of power and renown. 

* A hero's Valour rank describes his stature as a doer of great deeds, and is a measure of his courage in the face of dangerous situations or opponents.  
* A character’s Wisdom rank defines his selfunderstanding and capability for good judgement, and is a measure of his resistance to the corrupting power of the Shadow.

Both scores range from 1 to 6, and rise over the course of the game.  A starting player gives a score of 2 to one characteristic and 1 to the other. If a player chose to put 2 puts into Valor, then the hero will receive a Reward.  If Wisdom, then the hero will receive a Virtue. When heros gain a rank, they will put an additional point into either Valor or Wisdom and will recieve either an additional Virtue or Reward.
