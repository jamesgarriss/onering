# Valor and Wisdom

Valour and Wisdom measure a hero's resistance to Fear and the Shadow and track his stature in terms of power and renown. 

* A character’s Wisdom rank defines his self-understanding and capability for good judgement and is a measure of his resistance to the corrupting power of the Shadow.
* A hero's Valour rank describes his stature as a doer of great deeds and is a measure of his courage in the face of dangerous situations or opponents.  

Both scores range from 1 to 6, and rise over the course of the game.  A starting player gives a score of 2 to one characteristic and 1 to the other. If a player chooses to put 2 points into Wisdom, then the hero will receive a Virtue. If a player chooses to put 2 points into Valor, then the hero will receive a Reward.  When heros gain a rank, they will put an additional point into either Wisdom or Valor and will recieve an additional Virtue or Reward.

## Virtues

Virtues are unique abilities and special talents.  They represent a special quality or talents practised until they become second nature.  All are beneficial, but often apply only under strict conditions. As these requisites are as varied as the effects of the Virtues themselves, players are advised to read each Virtue description carefully, to understand when best to use it. 

### Masteries

These talents can be acquired by adventurers from any culture. Each Mastery can be acquired more than once by the same character.

Confidence - Overcoming difficulties has hardened your spirit, and at the same time renewed your faith in a brighter future.  Raise your maximum Hope rating by 2 points. When you choose this mastery, set your Hope score again to its maximum rating.

Dour-handed - When you throw a weapon or bend your bow, your hand is steady and your aim is sure.  Raise your ranged Damage rating by 1. 

Expertise - You have practised a skill until it has become as natural as breathing.  You can choose a new favoured skill (either a Common skill or a Weapon skill).
 
Fell-handed - You have learned to put all your strength into your blows in hand-to-hand battle.  Raise your close combat Damage rating by 1.

Gifted - Adventuring is honing your inborn talents. Raise one of your favoured Attributes by one. 

Resilience - Your determination and stamina have improved through hardship and toil.  Raise your maximum Endurance rating by 2 points. When you choose this Mastery, set your Endurance score again to its maximum rating.

### Cultural Virtues 

Cultural Virtues are the secrets of the dwellers of Middle-earth, from the proverbial stubbornness of Dwarves to the subtle magic of Elves

Bardings - The Bardings are Northmen of the noblest blood, valiant men with a tradition of powerful kings. Considered lost for many long years, their ancient heritage has been tempered anew in dragon-fire, and is today once again in capable hands.

* Birthright - Heir to an illustrious household (increased standard of living)

* Great Strength - Extra strength and nimbleness when fighting unencumbered (bonus to parry)

* Ravens of the Mountain - Befriended a raven (limited command of a raven)
* The Stiff Neck of Dwarves - Stubborn and unyielding (improved skill rolls)

Elves - Elves and magic are almost synonymous to most inhabitants of Middle-earth. The word itself invokes images of their grace, the products of their craft, and their unearthly beauty.

* Elvish Dreams - Can recover while doing repetitive tasks, like walking (recover endurage daily)
* Shadow Bane - A bitter hate for the Enemy (extra die when attacking Shadow servants)
* The Speakers - Communicate with almost anything (animals, plants, inanimate matter)
* Wood-elf Magic - Mastery of "Elf-magic" (various spells)

Hobbits - Hobbits rarely display Virtues considered to be heroic by other races, which partly explains their absence from history as written by Elves and Men. But to the discerning eye, these merry fellows reveal subtle qualities, often excelling in fields where stronger individuals might fail. 

* Art of Disappearing - The right moment to turn away from the attention of others (Hope to disappear)
* Brave at a Pinch - Bravery when in a tight place (Hope for a bonus against Weary)

Woodmen - The qualities that let the Woodmen clans survive in one of the most dangerous corners of Wilderland are subtle and diverse, and all have been put to the test during years of constant struggle against the darkness of Dol Guldur. 

* A Hunter’s Resolve - The inner strength of a relentless hunter (Hope to recover endurance)
* Herbal Remedies - Concocting salves and remedies from herbs in Mirkwood (reduce weariness, eventually neutralize poison)

* Natural Watchfulness - Read a situation from the animals around you (improved awareness and explore rolls)
* Staunching Song - An echo of an ancient Elvish song (recover endurance points after a fight)

## Rewards

Rewards are pieces of war gear of superior craftsmanship, granted to a player-hero as an award for his deeds.  Rewards may be tributes given to the hero by his own folk or family or by a munificent lord honouring an adventurer by letting him choose a weapon or a suit of armour from his personal armoury. There are two types of Rewards – Qualities and Cultural Rewards.  Whatever their choice, players should integrate the decisions into their stories.

### Qualities

Qualities are generic enhancements that affect a single characteristic of any weapon or suit of armour that is used.

There are several types of Qualities, allowing players to raise the effectiveness of their armour, helm, shield or weapon. Most Qualities may be applied more than once to the same piece of gear, unless the upgrade is specifically highlighted as unique. 

Each single piece of equipment can receive a maximum of 3 Qualities in total. An item with 1 Quality is considered to be of fine make, one with 2 Qualities is a superior piece of equipment, and one with 3 Qualities is an object of worth.

* Cunning Make (armour, headpiece or shield) - A skilled craftsman has made this piece of equipment lighter or less cumbersome than its lesser counterparts, thus reducing its Encumbrance.
* Close-fitting (armour or headpiece) A skilful smith has made this piece of protective equipment more difficult to overcome with a piercing blow.
* Reinforced (shield, unique) The shield’s structure is reinforced, possibly with a metal rim or a larger iron boss, letting its wearer parry blows with greater ease.
* Grievous (weapon, unique) The weapon is strong and heavy, inflicting more harm on its targets.
* Keen (weapon, unique) Sharp and well-balanced, this weapon is more likely to produce a piercing blow when hitting its target.
* Fell (weapon, unique) Hard and straight, a piercing blow from a fell weapon is stopped less easily by a suit of armour.

### Cultural Rewards

Cultural Rewards are more specific improvements, typical of the military traditions of each folk. There are three different Cultural Rewards for every culture presented in the game: a player can select one of them when his character is entitled to a new Reward. Each Cultural Reward may be taken only once. Cultural Rewards may be combined with Qualities, where appropriate.

Adding a Cultural Reward to an item counts towards the maximum of 3 Qualities that can be attributed to it. 

Bardings - The city of Dale prospered in the North for centuries. When it was finally rebuilt, many relics of its proud heritage were found. Other valuables had been kept away from the ruin, as the prized possessions of ancient families that fled to Lake-town.

* Dalish Longbow - The bowyers of Dale used prodigiously tall and powerful staves of fine yew wood to make bows for their King’s men.
* Spear of King Bladorthin - The Dwarves of the Mountain forged these spears for a king who lived before the Dragon came. Their thrice
forged heads never lose their keenness, and their shafts are inlaid with gold.
* Tower Shield - The soldiers of Girion, Lord of Dale, carried great shields that were so tall that it was said that a grown man could completely hide behind them.

Beornings - The Beornings have gathered many uncommon pieces of war gear under the roof of Beorn’s wooden hall: the heirlooms of ancient families and the findings of years of life in the Wild.

* Giant-slaying Spear - A Giant-slaying Spear is an unusually long great spear made of ash wood, once used only from horseback.
* Noble Armor - Craftsmen of old have long laboured on these coats of leather, shaping and decorating them with lacquers and other ornaments.
* Splitting Axe - A Beorning Splitting Axe has a wedge-shaped head, capable of rending armour with its strokes, a hold-over from a time when a Northman needed a weapon capable of piercing the skin of a Dragon.

Dwarves - The fabulous hoard of Smaug contained countless treasures, artefacts created by craftsmen whose secrets are now lost. 

* Axe of the Azanulbizar - It is said that every Dwarf that survived the Battle of Azanulbizar returned from that battlefield bowed under a heavy burden, as he carried the weapons of those who died that day and whose bodies were burned in the pyre. 
* Dwarf-wrought Hauberk - The Dwarves of the Mountain make good coats of steel rings, but they cannot match the work of the armourers that lived before the Dragon came.
* Helm of Awe - The Dwarven heroes of old wore helms with visors crafted by the hammer of the smith in hideous shapes, to better dismay the enemy that looked upon them. 

Elves - The weaponsmiths of the Woodland Realm spent long years devising more efficient ways to defeat their enemies. The armouries of the Elvenking are filled with enough weapons to fight in many wars.

* Bitter Spear - These spears were made with ash wood from what is now called Dol Guldur, once home to many woodland Elves.
* Spearman’s Shield - The agile Elven warriors learnt long ago to profit from the protection of a small shield when using a great spear. These leaf-shaped bucklers are smaller than most.
* Woodland Bow - The Silvan Elves have always eschewed the great bows favoured by many folks in the North. They prefer shorter and lighter bows that can be bent as quickly as possible, as in a forest the enemy can be anywhere.

Hobbits - The Mathom-house at Michel Delving contains many weapons of different and unusual provenance, and some hang as trophies above the hearths of old houses in the Shire.

* Bow of the North Downs - One of the oldest stories told in the Shire remembers how a company of the best archers that the Shire could muster went north to aid the King in battle. They never returned, but a number of very strong bows are said to have been recovered from the battlefield and preserved to this day.
* King’s Blade - At times, country Hobbits find ancient swords inside fallen mounds, amid tilled fields or washed ashore along a watercourse. Unable to discover their precise origin, they call them simply ‘King’s Blades.’
* Lucky Armor - Suits of armour are very prized ornaments in the houses of the greater families of the Shire. The best among them can be still put to proper use, if an adventurous Hobbit demonstrates he deserves it. 

Woodmen - The four Houses of the Woodmen have always chosen keepers among their wise ones to guard the riches stored in their great halls.

* Bearded Axe - The most prized axes have a wide ‘bearded’ head, often scored with ancient runes of victory. The longer blade bites into enemies’ shields, and its hooked end can be used to disarm them.
* Feathered Armour - Radagast has blessed these suits of armour with his cunning, and now they don’t seem to make a sound when worn, whether they are made from animal skins or rings of steel.
* Shepherds-bow - When a bow of any type is deemed very powerful, the Woodmen of Wilderland treasure it and call it a ‘Shepherds-bow,’ as they would use it to protect their herds and cattle from the preying claws of the Eagles of the Misty Mountains.
